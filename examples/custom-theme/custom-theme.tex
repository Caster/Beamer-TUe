  \begin{itemize}
    \item This is a simple presentation using the TU/e Beamer theme
    \item It should use the correct font automatically, or issue a warning
    \item The title bar should have a custom, greenish colour
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Note that doing this is \emph{not} recommended!
      \item The TU/e has a style guide with colours, that are predefined in this Beamer

      theme, you should really use those, \alert{seriously}
      \item But if you really, really, really, want to... you can do this
